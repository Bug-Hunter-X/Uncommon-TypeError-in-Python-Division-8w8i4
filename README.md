This repository showcases an example of an uncommon TypeError encountered in Python when performing division. The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts division of an integer by a string, resulting in a TypeError. The `bugSolution.py` file provides a more robust solution by adding additional error handling to catch and manage such exceptions gracefully.  The improved solution handles not only ZeroDivisionError but also TypeErrors, providing more comprehensive error handling.
